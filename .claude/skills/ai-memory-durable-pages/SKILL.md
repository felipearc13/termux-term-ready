# ai-memory durable pages

Use this skill only for deliberate durable wiki mutations. Routine session capture is automatic, and permanent notes require an explicit user request.

## Tools in this cluster

- `memory_write_page` writes a durable wiki page for permanent project knowledge.
- `memory_delete_page` removes a durable wiki page by exact path.

## Writing durable memory

Write a page only when the user explicitly asks to remember something permanently, save a note, add an annotation, or record project knowledge. Do not use durable pages for transient progress, normal status updates, or next-session context.

Put the page title as a `# H1` on the first line of the body and omit the separate title argument. ai-memory derives the title from that H1. Keep the content concise and fact-like, with enough context that a future agent can apply it without rereading the whole session.

When the user explicitly wants a note to be temporary, pass `expires_at` as an
RFC3339 instant or a bare `YYYY-MM-DD` (the end of that day in UTC). After the
TTL, normal search, recent, and briefing reads hide the page; the next forget
sweep deletes it. A TTL outranks `pinned`, so do not combine them unless the user
has deliberately requested that behavior.

## Project rules belong in instructions first

If the user asks to create a durable project rule such as always do X or never do Y, update the project's canonical agent instruction file when the repository says one exists. Use a durable page only when the user explicitly wants the rule in the wiki too, or when no canonical instruction file applies.

## Deleting durable memory

Delete only by exact path. If the user gives a vague title or topic, first resolve it to the page path using read-only lookup. Preserve sibling projects unless the user explicitly names them.

## Scope default

Default to the current project. Pass workspace and project together only when the user explicitly names a different project. Never pass scope arguments for phrases like this project, here, we, or our work.

## Architectural decisions get ADR structure and a pin

When the user asks to record an architectural decision (a chosen approach, a rejected alternative, a standing trade-off), write it as a durable page under `decisions/<short-slug>.md` with `pinned: true` and this structure in the body:

```markdown
# <Decision title>

**Status:** accepted   <!-- proposed | accepted | superseded by [[decisions/other]] -->

## Context
What situation forced a decision; the constraints that mattered.

## Decision
What was decided, stated as a fact.

## Consequences
What becomes easier, what becomes harder, what was given up.
Rejected alternatives and WHY, so future sessions don't re-propose them.
```

Pinned pages are exempt from retention decay and curation, and the auto-improvement path refuses to rewrite them — the record stays immutable unless a human unpins it. To supersede a decision, write a NEW page and set the old page's status line to `superseded by [[decisions/<new>]]`; never edit the old decision's substance. Note: ai-memory never touches files in the project repository — a `docs/adr/` directory managed there (by hand or by another tool) is outside ai-memory entirely; these wiki ADRs complement it for cross-session retrieval.

## Standing user/team preferences go to the global scope

When the fact is a standing preference that should apply to EVERY project — technology choices ("always use pnpm workspaces"), code style ("prefer composition over inheritance"), personal conventions ("never `--force` without asking") — call `memory_write_page` with `scope: "global"` instead of the current project. The page lands in the reserved `_global` scope, and default memory reads surface it in every project as `global_scope_hits`. `scope: "global"` cannot be combined with workspace/project arguments. Use it only for genuinely cross-project preferences; project-specific rules stay in the project (or its instruction file, per the section above).
